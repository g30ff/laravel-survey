#Survey App

The Survey Application allows for surveys to be created and taken by users.  The survey can have an arbitrary amount of questions, each of which can have an arbitrary amount of answers.  The surveys are in multiple choice format, where only one of the available answers can be selected. It has user registration and login for access control.  It is built using Laravel 5.4, using Vagrant, Homestead, PHP 7.1 and Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.4.0-51-generic x86_64).
